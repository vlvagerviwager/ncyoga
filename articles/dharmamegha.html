               	  <article>
                    <p>As part of my studies in yoga philosophy, I read the text "<b>The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali</b>" with commentary by Sri Swami Satchidananda.</p>

                    <p>Not a lot is known about the Indian sage Patanjali, who desired to record and compile the yogic teachings of the time. A <i>sutra</i> is a suture, the barest (in terms of conciseness) thread of teaching to be further elaborated upon by a teacher. The compiled sutras have been dated from the first to the fifth century. The sutras lay out the eight limbs of Ashtanga yoga - not to be confused with Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, the practice originating in Mysore and popularised by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois - as well as discussing the method for reaching various types and levels of <i>samadhi</i> (union, bliss) through mastering our mental modifications via the eight limbs and meditation.</p>

                    <p>My favourite sutra to contemplate upon is <b>Sutra 29</b> from Book Four.</p>

                    <blockquote><p>One who, due to his or her perfect discrimination, is totally disinterested even in the highest rewards, remains in the constant discriminative discernment, which is called <i>dharmamegha</i> (cloud of <i>dharma</i>) <i>samadhi</i>.</p></blockquote>

                    <p>Swami Satchidananda notes that <i>dharma</i> can mean virtue, justice, law, duty, morality, religion, religious merit, and steadfast decree. The Bhagavad Gita's battle takes place upon the field of Kurukshetra, also called Dharmakshetra; there, the meaning of <i>dharma</i> is alluded to cosmic order, purpose, or destiny.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy this sutra as it is a goal to strive towards, yet worded in a paradoxical way. Because of that, I perceive it as a gem; that there is an important teaching contained within, but only apparent when an effort is made to understand it.</p>

                    <p>This sutra says that <i>dharmamegha samadhi</i> can be achieved only if the reward of reaching it is not desired anymore. Swami Satchidananda gives familiar examples to illustrate what is meant by this paradox: one is that while trying to fall asleep, the intense desire to fall asleep does not lead to sleep. Rather, when sleep happens, the desire to sleep goes away simultaneously. We need to be aware of this in order not to fall into the trap of getting mentally attached to goals - as we experience with sleep, that does not help us realise what we want.</p>

                    <p>My own interpretation of this is that "being kind" is a goal like <i>dharmamegha samadhi</i>. One cannot simply put effort into "being kind" in an abstract manner, without any action, or the reverse, with intense contemplation upon this desire. Meditating on "I am kind" will not help one reach the status of a kind person. Only by performing kind acts selflessly and continuously without expectation (<i>akusidasya</i>, without self-interest - as in the path of Karma Yoga), suddenly one becomes a kind person.</p>

                    <p>Like meditation, one needs to maintain conscious awareness and do, rather than think. In meditation there is always a point of focus, and there is no way of determining when one will enter a "truly" meditative state (at least, for beginners). We simply need to make the effort and trust that we will arrive eventually, without being attached to it so much that we obstruct our own path there with psychological constructs such as expectation and judgement. Without focus, there is no hard work; hard work without faith that it will succeed is set up for failure. Hard work poisoned by egoic thinking ensures that we will not reach our goal.</p>
